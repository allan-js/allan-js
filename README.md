## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Allan

I like building stuff from electronics, mechanical systems, and computer software.
## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
1. Daraza Gateway. A payment platform that makes it so easy to integrate payments into an application in as little as 5 minutes
2. GEPA Systems. A compact, modular and scalable Irrigation Automation Computers (called WEMC). It makes it easy and affordable for a small farmer in Africa to automate his irrigation with so much precision as a large-scale farmer in Europe would.
