# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Allan

I like building stuff. I build electronics, mechanical systems, and computer software.
## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
1. Daraza Gateway. A payment platform that makes it so easy to integrate payments into an application in as little as 5 minutes
   www.daraza.net
2. GEPA Systems ðŸŒ±. A compact, modular and scalable Irrigation Automation Computer (called WEM-C). It is easy to use and affordable for a small farmer in Africa or any third-world Country enabling him/her to automate his/her irrigation with as much precision as a large-scale farmer in Europe would.
